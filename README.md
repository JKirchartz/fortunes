# Fortune Files

Quote databases have a line or lines containing a quote, then a line that only contains a '%' (percent sign) to separate it from the others.  ex:

    Let's just pretend Quote 1 is very
    ...very...
    ...very...
    long.
    %
    and quote 2 is short
    %

after adding or altering a new file recreate the index files for

    strfile <filename>

you can compile every fortune file in this directory with `make`

use these with `fortune` like:

    fortune ~/path/to/this/repo/named/fortunes

or you can combine these with the fortune files already on your system by asking fortune where it's databases are like so:

    fortune ~/path/to/this/repo/named/fortunes $(fortune -f 2>&1 | head -n1 | cut -d' ' -f2)
