Maybe BOB knows God, and that is why he always knows what I am feeling inside. God must be telling him what to do to me. God wants me not to be afraid, maybe, of being dirty. If I'm not afraid, he'll take me to heaven. I hope so.

Many years ago, I was given a Church of the SubGenius membership by my sother. I didn't know what the church was, so read about it. It looked to me like an excuse for my man to quit his job, commit acts of violence, and have sex with anyone and anything without caring about how any of this would affect me. Maybe you can understand why this did not fill me with great enthusiasm for the church. I don't remember if I tossed the membership packet or burned it. Maybe I made him eat it.

Personally, I think there is something very off with the "Church". However, one of the key tenets of the church is to bury criticism of it within mountains of disinformation! You'll read an amazing "expose" of the Subgenii, then find out it was written by one of the key members.
